## ðŸŒ¸ CNN-Based Image Classification on TF Flowers
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

A CNN model was built using TensorFlow to classify images from the TF Flowers dataset into 5 categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.

---

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- Source: TensorFlow Datasets (`tf_flowers`)
- Classes: 5
- Images: ~3,600+
- Preprocessing: 150x150 resizing, normalization, 80/20 train-test split

---

## ðŸ§  Model

- Layers: Conv2D â†’ MaxPool â†’ Conv2D â†’ MaxPool â†’ Conv2D â†’ MaxPool â†’ Flatten â†’ Dense â†’ Output
- Activation: ReLU (hidden), Softmax (output)
- Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: 15  
- Batch Size: 32

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Training Accuracy: 99.86%
- Validation Accuracy: 65.94%
- Test Accuracy: 65.94%
- Overfitting observed after ~6â€“7 epochs

---

## âœ… Conclusion

The model learned training data well but did not generalize effectively. To improve:
- Use data augmentation
- Add dropout layers
- Apply early stopping
- Try transfer learning
